Who am I? Who I am видимо неправильно
Who I am правильно когда это не основной вопрос
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am? так правильно
Do you know who am I? неправильно

"Who am I?" would be correct if you are asking yourself who you are.
так и хочется в конце поставить ... who are you это неправильно, тут нет вопроса
и возможно who am I и who I am обе правильные формы, просто исключения

Could you please tell me who am I because I don't know who I am?
I often ask myself 'Who am I?' because I don't really know who I am.
